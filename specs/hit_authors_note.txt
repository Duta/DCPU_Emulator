Author's Note:

    A. I wanted a floppy spec.

    B. I wanted a little bit of Cave Johnson.

    I tried to write Harold Lam as an antagonistic, blindly patriotic man who
    is none the less a savvy businessman who has managed to build up an IT
    empire despite his at-times dogmatic approach.

    Plus, I figured it could be a source of fun in the game's backstory to have
    at least two, at-odds technology companies (all gone and turned to dust by
    now) taking pot shots at one another through the eloquent medium of spec
    sheets. Or at least *one* technology company at-odds with and taking pot-
    shots at *everyone else*.

    In response to this, the engineers do their best to subtly mock him.  Like
    the result of command 0xFFFF: they don't specify whether it's signed or
    not.  The command is only there at all because Lam decreed it thus.

    Also, originally I mistakenly thought that Nya Elektriska was Russian.  I
    have no excuses for why; that's just what popped into my head when I first
    saw the name.  I'd like to apologise to everyone for the mistake.  I've
    since revised Lam's introduction to the HMD2043.

    As for implementation, I've tried to include enough explicit timing
    information to make working out how many cycles to "block" for relatively
    easy.  The only possibly tricky bit is the non-blocking mode.  For that to
    be efficiently implemented, the emulator will need some kind of event queue
    for keeping track of upcoming events.

    Although it would be more realistic to have the data trickle into memory
    during a non-blocking operation, I think we can probably get away with just
    doing it all-at-once at the end of the wait time for now.

    Incidentally, the design of the disks *more or less* matches that of the
    real 1.44 MB 3.5" disks.  In order to make them more DCPU-16 friendly, I
    specified that the sectors on both sides of the disc are really one, giving
    us sectors that are twice the size (by number of bits), but with the same
    overall physical configuration and capacity.
